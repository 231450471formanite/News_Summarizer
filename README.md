# Document Summarization with Transformers

This project demonstrates document summarization using the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model. The BART model is a large pre-trained transformer-based model that is fine-tuned for text generation tasks, including document summarization.

## Overview

The provided code showcases how to use the BART model to generate summaries for input documents. It utilizes transfer learning, which leverages the pre-trained weights of the BART model to perform document summarization tasks with relatively less training data.

The code is designed to be concise, as the heavy lifting of model training and architecture is already handled by the pre-trained BART model. It focuses on utilizing the model for inference and generating summaries based on the provided input document.

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

2. Update the input document:
Replace the placeholder `"Your input document goes here..."` in the code with the actual document you want to summarize.

3. Run the code:

4. View the generated summary:
The program will output the generated summary for the input document.

## Notes

- The BART model used in this project is `facebook/bart-large-cnn`, which is a large pre-trained model fine-tuned for document summarization tasks.

- **Transformer models are computationally intensive and require significant computational resources and large amounts of training data. The provided code takes advantage of transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained BART model's capabilities, reducing the need for extensive training on a specific task.**

- The code uses the Hugging Face `transformers` library, which provides a high-level API for working with transformer models and tokenization.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs, such as incorporating data preprocessing, handling multiple documents, or fine-tuning the model further.

For more information on the BART model and transformer-based text generation, refer to the Hugging Face Transformers documentation.
